> A fast shell script to leverage R&D on HPC just at $HOME

Without `sudo` permission; Support `fish`, `zsh` with native local compile; Providing an out-of-the-box environment for AI Development with essential software pre-configured on `amd64`, `aarch64`, and `ppcle-64` machine;

## Project Mission

Our goal is to help PhD students, researchers, open-source contributors and enterprise employees overcome the challenges of working with unfamiliar high-performance computing (HPC) architectures. Setting up a development environment on an unknown architecture can take months and be a frustrating experience. Our mission is to save time and make the process more enjoyable - just like Python does. By providing a user-friendly development environment, we aim to help our users focus on their work and enjoy a better life.
