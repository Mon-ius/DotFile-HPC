## Project Mission

Our goal is to help PhD students, researchers, open-source contributors and enterprise employees overcome the challenges of working with unfamiliar high-performance computing (HPC) architectures. Setting up a development environment on an unknown architecture can take months and be a frustrating experience. Our mission is to save time and make the process more enjoyable - just like Python does. By providing a user-friendly development environment, we aim to help our users focus on their work and enjoy a better life.
